        <div class="description">
            Once every night, the growl of the bear resonates through the
            village if a wolf is directly beside you. If you are a wolf, the
            bear may or may not growl every night regardless of the presence of
            wolves beside you.
        </div>

        <button class="collapsible">Crow</button>
        <div class="description">
          Once every night, you may designate a player. The designated target
          is announced to the entire village the next morning. When tallying the
          votes for lynching, the total vote count for the designated target is
          doubled.

        <button class="collapsible">Fox</button>
        <div class="description">
          Once every night, you may sniff three consecutive players around the
          village. Your flair, strangely unreliable, only lets you know if there
          is at least one wolf among them. If you fail to find a wolf, your confidence in your flair is gone. You may never use your ability again.
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="role" id="healer">
        <button class="collapsible">Healer</button>
        <div class="description">
          Once every night, you may choose to heal any one player including
          yourself. If the healed player was attacked during the night, the
          attack is negated. No player may be healed two nights in a row.

        <button class="collapsible">Hunter</button>
        <div class="description">
          In the moment before you die, your role is revealed to the village.
          You may then choose to shoot another player with your rifle and bring
          them down with you.
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="role" id="idiot">
        <button class="collapsible">Idiot</button>
        <div class="description">
          In the moment where you are designated to be hung, your role is
          revealed to the village. Feeling foolish for having thought you
          capable of such devious crimes, the villagers decide to spare you.
          However, they lose trust in your capacity to make an informed decision
          any longer stripping your right to vote for any future decisions.
        </div>

        <button class="collapsible">Omen</button>

          Once every night, you may curse a player of your choice. The cursed

          Once over the course of the game, after a lynching is complete, you
          may reveal your role and initiate a new lynching.
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="role" id="psychic">
        <button class="collapsible">Psychic</button>
        <div class="description">
          Once every night, you may compare the aura of two players of your
          choice. It will be revealed to you if they can win the game together
          or not.
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="role" id="pupil">
        <button class="collapsible">Pupil</button>
        <div class="description">
          Once over the course of the game when a player is announced dead,
          you may opt to reveal your role and replace it with that player’s.
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="role" id="scarecrow">
        <button class="collapsible">Scarecrow</button>
        <div class="description">
          Once every night, you may designate a player. The designated
          target is announced to the entire village the next morning. When
          tallying the votes for lynching, the total vote count for the designated target is halved.

      <div class="role" id="seer">
        <button class="collapsible">Seer</button>
        <div class="description">
          Once every night, you may see the true nature of a player of your
          choice. A vision from a powerful being above shall reveal whether
          that player is a wolf or not.
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="role" id="sibling">
        <button class="collapsible">Sibling</button>
        <div class="description">
          Once every night, all remaining siblings meet for a brief silent
          exchange. Once over the course of the game, they may elect to
          execute a player provided they unanimously agree to do so.
        </div>

        <button class="collapsible">Thief</button>
        <div class="description">

      <div class="role" id="veteran">
        <button class="collapsible">Veteran</button>
        <div class="description">
          If you are attacked by the wolves, you are announced wounded in
          the morning. You will die after the lynching of the day. If you
          were lynched, your role is revealed to the village. The guilt
          causes the village to cease functioning, henceforth all players
          lose access to their roles’ abilities.
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="role" id="witch">
        <button class="collapsible">Witch</button>
        <div class="description">
          You brewed two elusive potions to use over the course of the game,
          one that heals and one that kills but only with a full dose.
          Absent minded as you are, you don’t remember which flask contains
          which potion. Once every night, you discover who has been
          attacked. You may then choose to use potions on players of your
          choice.
