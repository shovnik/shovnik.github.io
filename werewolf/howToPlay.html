                Assemble a group of seven to twenty players as well as someone
                willing to be game master to begin a game of werewolf. Refer to
                the <a href="roles.html" class="role">role</a> and
                <a href="allegiances.html"  class="allegiance">allegiance</a>
                card distribution chart to select the cards that form each of
                the two sets based on the number of players. The game master
                then distributes one <a href="roles.html" class="role">role</a>
                card and one <a href="allegiances.html" class="allegiance">
                allegiance</a> card face down to each player respectively.
                Players should discretely glance at the cards they were dealt to
                discover what character they will be playing this game. There is
                a total of 192 unique character combinations of
                <a href="roles.html" class="role">role</a> and
                <a href="allegiances.html" class="allegiance">allegiance</a> a

            <h2>Gameplay</h2>
            <div class="description">
              <p class="text">
                The game consists of continuously cycling night and day phases
                always beginning with a night. Players considered dead give
                their cards to the game master, leave the game, and may spectate
                the rest of the game from the sidelines. A game ends when no
                players with opposing win conditions associated with their
                <a href="allegiances.html" class="allegiance">allegiance</a> remain.
              </p>
              <br/>
              <strong>Night:</strong>
              <p class="text">
                During the night, all players close their eyes and attempt to be
                as quiet as possible. The game master directs the flow of the
                night by calling players with specific
                <a href="roles.html" class="role">roles</a> or
                <a href="allegiances.html" class="allegiance">allegiances</a> to
                wake in turn based on the call order provided below. When
                players are called by the game master, they may open their eyes
                and make decisions using signs but must remain silent. Once a
                player’s action is complete, they must close their eyes once
                again.
              </p>
              <p class="text">
                In addition to all the abilities associated with
                <a href="roles.html" class="role">roles</a> and
                <a href="allegiances.html" class="allegiance">allegiances</a>,
                all werewolves except for a dream wolf wake up together once
                every night to select one player to attack that night. Once all
                actions are complete, at the signal of the game master, players
                wake up. The game master then announces those who have been
                killed, wounded, designated, or cursed as the result of the
                actions that took place in the night after which the day phase
                ensues.
              </p>
              <br/>
              <strong>Day:</strong>
              <p class="text">
                  At the beginning of the first day of the game, players nominate
                each other or themselves to be the captain of the village. Those
                nominated may optionally give a speech explaining why they wish
                to be captain. A captain is then elected by popular vote and
                given a special item to be distinguishable as captain to all
                other players (hat, rock, cushion, etc.). The vote of the
                captain serves as a tie breaker during the lynching process. If
                at any point the captain dies, the captain may choose who shall
                be the next captain and give them the special item.
              </p>
              <p class="text">
                  During the core of the day, players discuss and deliberate for a
                limited time to share information, deceive, and gain insight on
                the characters of the other players. They must then move on to
                accusations where they nominate candidates to be lynched. A vote
                for the lynching is then made, and the winning candidate is
                considered lynched by the village and dies. Promptly, the
                following night begins unless the game has ended.
