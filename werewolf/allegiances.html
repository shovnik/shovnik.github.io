              Every night, you may spend the night with the player of your
              choice. You get killed if your lover is attacked rather than if
              you yourself are attacked. Careful, if you sleep with a wolf, the
              wolf devours you.

              You have a big bad appetite. Starting from the second night, you

              You live on a different time zone always doing things at your own
              pace. You awaken alone after the pack. You may then elect to shift

              anti-clockwise.

              The pack never treated you as one of theirs. Bullied and outcasted
              since you were a cub, you wait patiently for the chance to betray
              the pack and become a lone wolf at last. Starting from the third
              night, you awaken an additional time when you may murder a fellow
              wolf in their slumber.

              Sometimes you wish you had a better reason for doing this, but the
              truth is that there is simply nothing you crave more than a juicy
              soul. At the start of every night following the first, the souls
              of the dead players visit you. You may consume the one of your
              choice and gain its abilities for the rest of the game.

          <div class="description">
              There is nothing in the world you fantasize more than getting
              lynched. The intense feeling as the rope tightens around your neck
              but a moment away from eternal silence. As thanks for lynching
              you, after you die, you may give one of the lucky few who voted
              for your lynching the sweet release of death.
