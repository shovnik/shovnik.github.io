# Arcade Games

All the games on the site were made from scratch using the p5 and p5dom javascript librairies. 

The project combines functional programming and object oriented programming using the ES7 syntax. Functions are always placed in alphabetical order for easy navigation as logical/execution order isn't very relevent in the context of game event listeners. The skill, grid size, or difficulty of any of the games can be changed through global variables to encourage scalibility at the start of each file if appropriate for the particular game.
